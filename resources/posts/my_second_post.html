    <p>An article is basically a direct conversation with your 
        reader. If a portion in an exam is for you to write an article, 
        the reader may be identified or specified as part of the instructions. 
        That way you can write your article as if you are directly discussing your 
        topic with them. In this sense, the tone, sentences, and words you use in 
        your article must be conversational and easy to understand for your readers. 
        More importantly, you need to remember that the main goal is to cater to your 
        readers; you need to be able to spark their interest and sustain in 
        all throughout the article.</p>
